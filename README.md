## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KojinKuro/news-reader.git

```

Note: This project requires you to have an API key for the News API. You can learn how to do this [here](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started). Once you obtain a key, create an `.env` file in the root folder with the following contents.

```
VITE_API_KEY=yourapikey
```

The server should be running locally on: `localhost:5173`

## Context

This project was created by one developer, me! It took an estimated ~8 hours to complete this project. There are many features missing, but the goal of this was to see how much that I could complete within 8 hours. It was meant to act as a simulation of a take home challenge from a company.

For managing the project tasks, I used a mix of Github Projects with some note taking. If anyone intrested, here's the [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/5KCOPVOCorNC51uUfAqviS/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=wYm3IQWFNoCS4suD-1)

This project proved challenging in that I had been working on personal projects before this where I had an infinite amount of time to work on features and polish on things till I was happy with them. This project being constrainted to 8 hours proved hard, given that I had trouble prioritizing and making quick decisions on design and features. This project has missing features and is not fully tested, but was as far as I could get given the time.
